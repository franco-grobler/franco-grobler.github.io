Computer scientists and engineers are not well known for their sense of humor,
yet GitHub proves some of us have at least read about what a "sense of humor"
is.

Cowsay is one of these projects. It is a simple pearl project, printing cows to
the terminal using ASCII characters. Since the project is written in pearl, it
had to rust at some point. I decided I would be the one to do it.

## Everything rust's eventually

Since rust has gained popularity, it seems like every single project is being
rewritten in Rust. Not a particular reason, just because someone wanted to. I
don't believe a better reason exists to start an open source project, which is
way I did the same.

## Why Rust?

I had only used rust once previously; to write a encrypted message exchange
between a website and a payment server for a banking application. Rust has
become increasingly popular, thus I surrendered to FOMO.

Rust is of course known for achieving close to C speeds, without needing to
thing too much about memory management and overflows, since the rust compiler is
the mentor we all wish we had.
