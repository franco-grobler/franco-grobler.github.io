You are not Google.

Most architects forget what modern computers or capable of, or who they work
for. Small scale applications will future proof with event driven asynchronous
architectures running on highly available Kubernetes clusters in three
availability zones, and disaster recovery ready on every continent.

These applications are engineering marvels, but it begs the question, are you

While microservices architecture has gained significant popularity in recent
years, monolithic applications continue to be a viable and effective choice for
many modern web applications. This article explores the strengths and weaknesses
of monolithic architecture, examining its suitability for various use cases. We
discuss key factors to consider when choosing between monolithic and
microservices, such as team size, project complexity, and performance
requirements. By debunking common misconceptions and highlighting practical
advantages, we aim to demonstrate that monolithic applications are far from
obsolete and can still be a powerful tool in the modern developer's toolkit.
