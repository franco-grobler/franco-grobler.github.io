  experience:
    - title: Senior DevOps Engineer
      company:
        name: Lexis Nexis
        url: https://lexisnexis.com
      description: Part of the global shared service cloud engineering team,
        tasked with developing a provider-agnostic pipeline interface as a
        Python package. This library exposes a cli for CI/CD workflows,
        abstracting the specifics of underlying CI providers such as Jenkins and
        GitHub Actions.

        I am also leveraging containerization within these pipelines to enable
        support for a wider range of development frameworks, ensuring a flexible
        and scalable CI/CD infrastructure.
      tools: ["Python", "Jenkins", "Github Actions", "Terraform"]

      description: Starting as a junior developer in July 2022, I was promoted
        to intermediate in September 2023, followed by a promotion to senior
        developer and team lead in November 2024. Byte Orbit's primary focus is
        within the Fintech industry, building API's with Django, Django REST
        framework, and Postgres. Smaller projects and proof-of-concepts allowed
        me to use Golang, NodeJS with ExpressJS (TypeScript), Vue3, and gain
        experience with Angular.

        My responsibilities include maintaining internal Python packages,
        mentoring graduates and vacation work students, and working with various
        product teams and other developers to deliver high-quality products
        on-time.
